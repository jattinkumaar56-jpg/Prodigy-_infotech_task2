# Prodigy-_infotech_task2
📊 Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project
✅ What I Did in This Project

📥 Imported the dataset and explored its structure, size, and features

🧹 Performed data cleaning to improve data quality

Checked and handled missing (null) values

Identified and removed duplicate records

Reviewed data types and ensured consistency

🔍 Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand data behavior

📊 Used visual analysis to identify patterns, trends, and relationships

🔗 Analyzed correlations between variables to understand dependencies

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

🐍 Python

📦 Pandas for data cleaning and manipulation

🔢 NumPy for numerical operations

📈 Matplotlib for data visualization

🎨 Seaborn for statistical and correlation plots

📓 Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis

📈 Key Findings & What the Data Tells

The dataset contained missing and duplicate values that required preprocessing

After cleaning, the data became more reliable for analysis

Distribution plots revealed how values are spread across key variables

Correlation analysis helped identify relationships between numerical features

Visualizations made trends and patterns easier to interpret than raw data

🧠 Conclusion

Proper data cleaning significantly improves the accuracy of analysis

Exploratory data analysis helps uncover hidden insights and relationships

Visual tools are essential for understanding data behavior and trends

This project demonstrates a complete workflow from raw data to meaningful insights
